# Summary:
One of our leading tech corporation clients has fallen prey to a sophisticated cyberattack by a notorious Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group known as APT34. The attack, believed to be sponsored by a foreign government, has left the organization’s network compromised, and valuable customer data and intellectual property has been stolen.

**In this project,** our mission is to conduct initial research on this APT group, APT34, and assess the extent of the breach's impact on the organization’s information security.

**As a result,** we will produce a comprehensive report documenting our findings and outlining key recommendations for improving the organization’s cybersecurity posture, While finding the answers for the following:
1. What is their history?
2. Which nation/state are they associated with?
3. Do they target specific industries?
4. What are their motives?
5. What are the TTPs they use to conduct their attacks?
6. What security measures could the client implement to defend against cyberattacks conducted by this APT?

## Tools & Resources:
* **[Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)](https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-open-source-intelligence/)** - tools and techniques to gather information on APT34. You can find some OSINT tools in the resources section; however, feel free to conduct your own individual research.
* **[MITRE ATT&CK Framework](https://attack.mitre.org/)** - a standardised tool used to identify and categorise cyberthreats, to develop a comprehensive defence strategy to protect the client's networks and systems against future attacks.
* **[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA):](https://www.cisa.gov/)**
* **[US-CERT:](https://www.us-cert.gov/)**
